#X text 287 17 [ce_comconnect] is a external used to monitor digital
and analog pins of diy dev boards.;
#X text 287 110 An arduino sketch is provied inside of the zip name
SerialArduinoEmulation.zip;
#X text 33 81 2022/11/13 6:13 AM;
#X text 289 148 Inside of this sketch modify how many digital and analog
pins are requred. Disconnect and reconnect the dev board. Refreh [ce_comconnect]
attempt to connect the device.;
#X text 283 202 About the sketch: The arduino sketch uses TimerOne.h
and SoftwareSerial.h to monitor uninturrputed momentary button presses
and analog pot value changes. This means loop is free of code and could
be utilized for more features.;
#X text 700 210 *Recommended* to copy this patch to a working directory
keep the original intact then make changes as you wish.;
#X text 702 10 One known small bug where the last banged pin is "banged"
directly before a newly banged pin even those the previously pin has
been released. Looks as though the pin index is not being updated correctly.
This will be sorted out soon. If you happen to correct my mistake please
use the "Report Isuue" button on the left side of this help document.

#X text 701 280 Total outlets depends on how many pins are used on
the dev board. As an example with a arduino mega utilizing 53 digital
pins using the bank selector each pin can have 10 different functions
as there is 10 banks to select from. For a total of 530 functions from
just 53 digital pins. And in turn 16 analog pins turns into 160 analog
pins. These numbers will vary based on the dev board choosen.;
#X text 124 488 Comport activity state 1 = A pin is high. 0 = A pin
is now low., f 63;
#X text 284 265 Preperations have been made for future versions to
be compatible with slave devices via RX TX. This process is partially
implemented currently not working.;
